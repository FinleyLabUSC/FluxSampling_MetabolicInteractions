# FluxSampling_MetabolicInteractions
Flux Sampling in Microbial Metabolic Interactions

For pairwise interactions: 
Pipeline is similar to the tutorial shown in: https://github.com/opencobra/COBRA.tutorials/tree/9bc1b6b301aab711272e9732b950763942c621f3/analysis/microbeMicrobeInteractions
Except, call simulatePairwiseInteractions_Sampling instead of simulatePairwiseInteractions
